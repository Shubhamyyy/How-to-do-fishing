    <P><H2><CENTER> <P style="color: red;">Catching fish can be a lot of fun; in fact,
         the catch is why most beginners learn how to fish. But catching is a process, so the 
         better beginners prepare, the more fish they catch. Below are a few beginner fishing
          tips to help increase those catches.</P></CENTER></H2></P>
          <P><H1><CENTER><P style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> WE ARE KNOW STEP BY STEP FISHING <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54690112e4b0ce841e49ad01/1474916675235-CAU5FC824KE4CBZ3AZN4/learning+to+fish?format=1500w">

    <P><H1><P style="color: red;"></P> Mark Up Your Soft Baits</H1></P>
    <P><H3>With indelible markers, you can add a number of realistic baitfish patterns to
         your soft-plastic baits. Get creative! Over time, the colors will “bleed” into the bait,
          giving them a unique fish-attracting appearance.</H3></P>

<P><H1><P style="color: red;">2. Stow Snaps And Swivels</P></H1></P>
<img src="https://www.onthewater.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/swivel-holder.jpg"
<P><H3>The most important links in your connection to a fish also happen to be the easiest to lose in your 
    tackle bag. To better keep these tiny pieces of terminal tackle, slide them one at a time onto a
     large snap, then attach that snap to a lanyard worn around your neck. It keeps the snaps and 
     swivels in easy reach when it’s time to re-tie in the middle of a hot bite.</H3></P>

<P><H1><P style="color: red;">3. Clip Your Trebles</P></H1></P>
<P><H3><center>Swap out the trebles for single hooks on most swimming plugs and you’ll change, or even ruin,
     the fish-catching action. To keep the plugs swimming right but gain the easy-unhooking benefits
      of single hooks, simply clip off the points on two of the tines, just behind the barb. Pliers 
      will cut most freshwater hooks, and a bolt cutter can take care of sturdier saltwater hooks.

      <p><h1><p style="color: red;">USE THE RIGHT KNOT FOR YOUR LINE</p></h1></p>
      <p><h3>Here is a knot tying tip that will help all anglers; with braided line, the best knot to use is
           a palomar knot. With fluorocarbon, a palomar is the worst knot you can tie because it burns itself as
            it cinches down and will break easily. Use an improved clinch knot with fluorocarbon. With monofilament,
             you can use either knot.</h3></p>

<P><H1><P style="color: red;">4. Cut Down on Tangles</P></H1></P>
<P><H3>The dreaded wind knot can be prevented, or at least reduced, by manually flipping over the bail on your 
    spinning reel after a cast. This keeps the line from twisting as it works its way from the bail to the line roller,
     which it does when the bail is snapped shut automatically by turning the reel handle.</H3></P>



<P><H1><P style="color: red;">5. Dress-Up your Jigs</P></H1></P>
<img src="https://www.onthewater.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/diamond-jig-breakaway-clip.jpg"
<P><H3>Diamond jigs are a classic striped bass, bluefish and cod lure that can be dressed with a bare hook, 
    a colored tube, or a feathered Siwash hook. The faster you can switch out these different dressed hooks to
     find the color and style that the fish are responding to, the faster you will be into fish. To do this,
      replace the split ring on the bottom of your diamond jig with a sturdy lure clip and swap out hook styles.</H3></P>
<img src=""

<P><H1><P style="color: red;">6. Sock It to Short Biters</H1></P>
<P><H3><center>Short-biting fish like sunfish, perch and scup will use their small mouths to grab the dangling end
     of your bait and tear it from the hook. To stop them from stealing your bait, use an Aberdeen hook with 
     a long shank and a small gap, and then thread the bait on the hook like a sock so that very little hangs off the end.
      This works with night crawlers in freshwater and sea worms and squid strips
       in saltwater.<img src="https://www.onthewater.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/aberdeen-style-hook.jpg"></center>
</H3></P>


<P><H1><P style="color: red;">7. Stop on Top</P></H1></P>
<P><H3>If you’re fishing a topwater lure and the stripers keep blowing up on the plug or tail-slapping it without
    hitting it, try stopping it cold and counting to five. A lure bobbing on the surface looks like a stunned baitfish –
     easy pickings – and will often draw a vicious strike.</H3></P>

<p><h1><p style="color: red;">8. Cripple Your Baitfish</p></h1></p>
<p><h3>When ice fishing with live shiners, a frisky bait can be tough for sluggish cold-water predators to chase down.
     Try slowing it down by clipping its tail fin with a pair of small scissors. This works in other situations too,
      like when fishing menhaden for stripers.</h3></p>

<p><h1><p style="color: red;">9.SALTWATER VS FRESHWATER</p></h1></p>
<ol>
   <h3> <li> So it is pretty obvious to most, the differences between freshwater fishing and saltwater fishing, 
        but there are some scientific points to consider in addition to simply the “Lake vs. Ocean” comparison. </li></h3>
    <h3><li>Freshwater fishing is when a fisherman fishes in a body of water that has less than 0.05% salinity. It is different
         than saltwater fishing because the species of fish are entirely different. Except some fish like Salmon, who are 
         born in freshwater, spend a few years at sea, and then return to spawn in the same freshwater body of water they were born in.  </li></h3>
   <h3> <li> One thing to keep in mind is that lakes, like ponds, rivers and all other bodies of water will have creel limits. 
        A creel limit is the amount of fish and/or size of fish you’re allowed to remove from that lake per day. </li></h3>
   <h3><li>If you are like me, and live inland you don’t always get the opportunity to saltwater fish,
         but the alternative can be just as fun and rewarding!  </li></h3>
</ol>

<center><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54690112e4b0ce841e49ad01/1475011993995-M3IDL5SDHVTSG7VP2U8D/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w"></center>
         <p><h1><p style="color: red;">9.SALTWATER VS FRESHWATER</p></h1></p>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>
            Map It – When fishing in a freshwater lake or pond you’ll want to get a topographical map of that body of water.
             This will let you know what and where the different depths of the lake or pond are. Along with that it
              may also show you locations of sunken man-made fish cribs. 
        </li></h3>
        <h3><li>
            Bait Matters! – The best type of bait is live bait! Worms, minnows, wax worms and soft shell (crayfish)
             are good ways to start. You will want to use the live bait is best for the species of fish you’re trying 
             to catch. Some other types of live bait that are also used are leeches and frogs or anything else live you 
             think the fish will go for! Artificial bait works also, with the popular options being spinners and crank baits. 
        </li></h3>
        <h3><li>
            Check the Water Temp – The majority of freshwater fish species have specific water temperature and
             weather that they prefer. The hotter it gets outside the deeper you’ll need to fish. Fish tend 
             to like cool temperatures and will move to deeper, cooler water as the temperature outside rises.
              During dusk and dawn, fish will come to more shallow water to feed. You’ll want to research the
               specific fish you’re trying to catch to figure out the best times and water depths to catch them.</li></h3>

        <h3><li>
            Keep those hands clean! – When fishing in water with little salinity you’ll really want to 
            make sure you keep your hands clean. Fish have a great sense of smell and any foreign scent on
             your bait or lures can turn them off. 
        </li></h3>
        <h3><li>
            Other Essentials – Aside from obviously needing a rod and reel, other things that you will eventually need would be 
            a tackle box, needle- nose pliers, a net, and perhaps an ice chest. Also a nice pair of polarized sunglasses will
             not only block the UV rays from the sun and the sun's glare on the water, but they will help you to see a little
              better into the water to locate fish. 
        </li></h3>

    <p><h1><p style="color: red;">9. SAFETY INFORMATION </p></h1></p>
<ol>
    <h3>
        <li>
            Safety first! – Growing up in Florida I can say, look out for Gators as tip numero uno! Especially
             if you are in the south and are using a small boat or canoe. 
        </li>
    </h3>
    <h3>
        <li>
            You always need to have the proper fishing license and/or stamps, if you’re caught fishing without them you could be in hot water.
        </li>
    </h3>
    <h3>
        <li>
            if you are going to wade in a river, pond, or lake make sure to use a wader belt to prevent water from 
            rushing into your waders. If in a boat, grab a life jacket. It is always good to have handy and necessary
             by law in most places. Lastly, don’t forget to drink plenty of water and apply the sun screen. 
        </li>

<p><h1><p style="color: red;">9. LAKE FISHING TIPS  </p></h1></p>
<center><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54690112e4b0ce841e49ad01/1474912618917-ZAOGRCAV6D5YCY171O87/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w"</center>
<ol>
    <h3>
        <li>
            Inlets and Outlets and Hang out Spots – Like humans, fish like specific temperatures and will 
            generally hang around areas of a lake that they find comfortable. Places where water enters or drains 
            from a lake will generally be much cooler and favorable to fish. Bait fish like to hang around these areas,
             along with the giant fish that eat them.
        </li>
    </h3>
    <h3>
        <li>
            Find Sunken Junk and Treasures – Fish like to hang around structures that make them feel safe and 
            that provide the opportunity to ambush other fish. Structures such as sunken trees, branches and man made
             fish habitats are a great place to fish. It’s a safe haven, or so they think… kind of how coral is in saltwater. 
        </li>
    </h3>
    <h3>
        <li>
            The Wind is on Your Side – On days with a strong breeze you can expect the bait fish to get pushed closer to shore,
             meaning the big fish will come closer to shore to feed. Watch for drift lines and follow them, they will 
             lead to bait fish, which will lead to the big fish you are looking for.
        </li>
    </h3>
    <h3>
        <li>
            Scout for Weeds – A lot of big fish, like northern pike and largemouth bass like to stalk their prey 
            from a nice cozy weed bed. Locate some weed beds in the lake your fishing in and try getting your bait 
            and/or lure in that area to see if you can coax a fish to bite. The weed beds that lead to deeper water 
            and create a break line are the best spots! 
        </li>

    <ol>
    <h3>
        <li>
            Remember, you don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars on fishing gear. Freshwater fishing should be fun,
             easy, and affordable. About 90% of the tackle on the market is meant to attract the fisherman, not the fish.

   <p><h1><p style="color: red;"> VISUALIZE THE STRIKE </p></h1></p>
  <ol>
      <h3>
          <li>
            My number one tip for beginners would be to always visualize the strike so that you have your 
            fundamentals down. Keep your rod tip where it needs to be for setting the hook. Always think about
            the bite so that your response is automatic and fundamentally sound. So often, beginning anglers have 
            poor fundamentals where they miss opportunities because they simply are not ready.
